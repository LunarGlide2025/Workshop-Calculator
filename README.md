# Calculator Application
Your task is to create a console-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application should fulfill the following requirements:

# Objectives:
#### • Implement the calculator application as a Maven project.
#### • The calculator should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Users should be able to enter the numbers and the operator to perform the desired operation.
#### • The program should continue running until the user chooses to end it. After each operation, the user should have the option to perform another calculation or exit the program.

# Optional:
#### • The addition and subtraction operations should be able to handle any number of operands.
#### • Implement proper exception handling to handle any errors or invalid inputs entered.
#### • Write JUnit tests to verify the correctness of each mathematical operation.
